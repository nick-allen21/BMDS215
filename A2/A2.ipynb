Next, you can examine misclassification ‚Äî especially whether it is differential across age, sex, race, site, or time‚Äîand audits data quality (missingness, coding variability, inter‚Äërater reliability), favoring standardized vocabularies such as RxNorm, LOINC, and ICD. By looking at multiple different proxies and vetting them in the aformentioned manner, you should be able to find proxies for a certain variable of interest. </span>"
